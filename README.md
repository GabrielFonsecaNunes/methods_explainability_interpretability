# Interpretability & Explainability in Machine Learning

This repository is dedicated to studying, implementing, and experimenting with different **interpretability** and **explainability** methods for Machine Learning models using **Python**.

The goal is to explore how and why models make decisions, and to build a practical reference for techniques that improve transparency, trust, and accountability in AI.
